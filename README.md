## 🎮 Game Idea

**Timr_loop** centers around a looping timer mechanic—each level gives you a set countdown (e.g., 30 seconds). During this loop, you'll:

- 🔄 Complete dynamic challenges (collect items, dodge hazards, solve quick puzzles)
- ⏱️ Beat the clock before it resets
- 🔼 Unlock power-ups or boosts between loops
- 🔁 Repeat with rising difficulty—shorter timers, more obstacles, smarter layouts

The quick reset-and-retry loop keeps the gameplay addictive, ideal for short, ultra-responsive sessions.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Addictive loop-based gameplay
- 🏆 Score-driven progression
- 🎛 Power-up system between loops
- 🔄 Progressive difficulty scaling
- 🌐 Cross-platform support (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Web)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Dart & Flutter
- `dart:async` for Timer logic

## 📦 Installation

git clone https://github.com/keronabil20/Timr_loop.git
cd Timr_loop
flutter pub get
````

## ⌨️ How to Play

1. Run the app using:

```bash
flutter run
```

2. A countdown starts — complete as many tasks as you can:

   * Tap to collect items
   * Swipe to dodge obstacles
   * Solve mini‑challenges before time’s up

3. When the timer hits 0:

   * Score is tallied
   * Difficulty increases
   * A new loop begins

4. See how high you can score before the loop wins!
